    <h1>1. How Do I Submit a Ticket?</h1>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none" class="p-0">
        <li>
In Order to submit a ticket you must create an account. Once your account is created you will be able to submit as 
many tickets as your heart desires. Please keep in mind we are IT people and not Robots, so it may take some time to fix.
If your problem involves hardware please bring it to the IT office in Room 404 Building A or Room 420 Building B. If the device is too large to
move please report the area and the asset tag of device for our team to find.

            If you have dual screens in 4k HD and screen cap that, we will not be able to access the file because it is so large, and please stop bragging.
